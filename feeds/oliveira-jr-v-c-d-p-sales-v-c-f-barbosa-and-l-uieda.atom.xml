&lt;p&gt;We have developed a fast total-field anomaly inversion to estimate the
magnetization direction of multiple sources with approximately spherical shape
and known centres. Our method can be applied to interpret multiple sources with
different magnetization directions. It neither requires the prior computation
of any transformation like reduction to the pole nor the use of regularly
spaced data on a horizontal grid. The method contains flexibility to be
implemented as a linear or non-linear inverse problem, which results,
respectively, in a least-squares or robust estimate of the components of the
magnetization vector of the sources. Applications to synthetic data show the
robustness of our method against interfering anomalies and errors in the
location of the sources' centre. Besides, we show the feasibility of applying
the upward continuation to interpret non-spherical sources. Applications to
field data over the Goiás Alkaline Province (GAP), Brazil, show the good
performance of our method in estimating geological meaningful magnetization
directions. The results obtained for a region of the GAP, near from the
alkaline complex of Diorama, suggest the presence of non-outcropping sources
marked by strong remanent magnetization with inclination and declination close
to -70.35° and -19.81°, respectively. This estimated magnetization direction
leads to predominantly positive reduced-to-the-pole anomalies, even for other
region of the GAP, in the alkaline complex of Montes Claros de Goiás. These
results show that the non-outcropping sources near from the alkaline complex of
Diorama have almost the same magnetization direction of that ones in the
alkaline complex of Montes Claros de Goiás, strongly suggesting that these
sources have emplaced the crust almost within the same geological time
interval.&lt;/p&gt;
